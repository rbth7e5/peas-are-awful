**Inspiration**

Plastic bag waste is no doubt a serious global issue, and the new bag waste reduction law passing that took effect in New York on 1st March 2020 was a step in the right direction. It encouraged us to always have a reusable bag on hand, otherwise we’d have to pay per plastic bag.
But what if we forgot to bring them or just did not have any? We had the intention to be sustainable, but it just couldn’t happen in that situation and in the end we brought about plastic waste.
To solve this problem, we came up with the idea to create a peer-to-peer economy for reusable shopping bags within school campus. Through a synchronized mobile application and kiosk system, students can easily borrow a reusable bag when the need arises. Situating it within a schoollike NYU, not only makes pickup/dropoff very convenient, but also encourages everyone in the community to get involved.

**What it does**
Our mobile application facilitates and tracks the borrowing, returning and donating of reusable shopping bags among the NYU student community. The map function makes it convenient to locate the nearest kiosk and check how many bags are available.The profile and tracking allows users to see their progress and understand the impact they are making. Finally, the social feed creates a community that encourages everyone to build sustainable habits together.

**How we built it**
Github
Firebase
ReactNativ
Google Maps API
We started by setting up the developer environment using Github and ReachNative to build the mobile application. To create the database, we used Firebase.

**Challenges we ran into**
When we started this project, we were unfamiliar with JavaScript and coding on ReactNative for a mobile application. However, with some research into online documentation and help from peers, we were able to figure out how to implement our project effectively.
Another challenge was setting up the QR code scanner in the app. We found that the 3rd party library was not configured properly and we had to dig into the code, study it and tweak it to run on our app properly

**What we learnt**
How to use JavaScript and coding on ReactNative with little/no prior experience
How to learn from documentation quickly and implement new or 3rd party code.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
Getting the mobile app to work smoothly through different user flows
Having a logical back-end system that updates instantly
What's next for BagX
